As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.\n\n### How to install\n\nWhen you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed!\n\nOtherwise `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli` or `yarn add webpack-cli --dev` will install it. \n\n### Commands\n\nSupporting developers is an important task for webpack CLI. Thus, webpack CLI provides different commands for many common tasks. We organize webpack CLI as a [multi-package repository](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Every command has a dedicated subfolder in the `packages` Folder.\n\n## Getting started\n\nWhen you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed! Otherwise, you would need to install webpack CLI and the packages you want to use. If we want to use the `init` functionality to create a new `webpack.config.js` configuration file:\n\n```sh\nnpm i webpack-cli @webpack-cli/init\nnpx webpack-cli init\n```\n\nYou will answer many questions when running the `init` so webpack CLI can provide the best fitting configuration.  \n\n## webpack CLI Scaffolds\n\nWith v3 of webpack CLI, we introduced scaffolding as an integral part of the CLI. Our goal is to simplify the creation of webpack configurations for different purposes. Additionally, sharing such solutions with the community is beneficial and with webpack webpack's we want to allow this. We provide `webpack-scaffold` as a utility suite for creating these scaffolds. It contains functions that could be of use for creating an scaffold yourself.\n\nYou can read more about [Scaffolding](./SCAFFOLDING.md) or check out the example project [How do I compose a webpack-scaffold?](https://github.com/evenstensberg/webpack-scaffold-demo).\n\n## Contributing and Internal Documentation\n\nThe webpack family welcomes any contributor, small or big. We are happy to elaborate, guide you through the source code and find issues you might want to work on! To get started have a look at our [documentation on contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack-cli",
